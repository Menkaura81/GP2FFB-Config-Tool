## A simple UI for the GP2FFB plugin for Grand Prix 2

Original plugin by Jake (GPLaps): https://github.com/gplaps/GP2FFB

GP2FFB Config Tool reads your `.ini` file and displays the values in the window. You can change them as you like, then save them back to the `.ini` file or launch the plugin.  

To install, just extract the files into the same folder as the plugin.
